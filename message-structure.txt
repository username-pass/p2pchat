3 layers


SENDING:
User input
- connected to input box
- inputs raw data
- formats inputted user data (on a basic level)

Routing to correct end users
- messages are stored in "channels", where each "channel" has a list of users in it.
 - in the "channel" the messages stored will store when they were sent, and which recipients ended up receiving them.
- routes the message to the correct "channel"
- turns the channel message data to raw messages and list of users to send it to

sending to end users
- sends the message data to all individual users, and sends data about what channel it's in

RECEIVING:
receiving from end users
- receives raw requests to end users
- filters out "untrusted" users
 - users with no "trusted" boolean set in the user list
 - adds them to the known users if the ID is unknown
- sends the data to be routed

routing to correct users and channels
- parses the message, and finds out what channel to send it in
- ensures that the sender is a part of the receiving channel, otherwise send a warning that the channel may be compromised
- adds it to the channel data
- sends an update request

End user UI
- upon receiving update request, determine if that is the current channel
- if it's the currently displayed/focused channel, display the new message
- otherwise, mark it as "unread", and display a "notification" in the other channel
